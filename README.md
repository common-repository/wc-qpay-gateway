# Gateway for Qpay on WooCommerce (^_^)

> WordPress plugin for `WooCommerce - Payment Gateway` using [QPay](https://qpay.mn/)

- We wanted to enable shops that are built on WordPress to pay easily
- However there were no readily available WordPress plugin for Mongolian banking gateways or QPay
  - Some were unreliable (NO official maintenance or downloadable from marketplace), some were too pricey (100k monthly)
- Thats why we decided to build one ourselves and make it free to use for everyone

## Getting Started

- Install [LocalWP](https://localwp.com/) on your machine
  - Create new site
- Install [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) plugin & configure
  - Create product
- Install `Gateway for Qpay on WooCommerce` zip file
- Buy product
